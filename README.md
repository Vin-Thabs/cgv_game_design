# cgv_game_design

# Overview
THrough the combination of WEbGL and THREE.js object3D.
We created a game world and imported models built through Blender.

So Scene, Rendere, Camera, Lights, as basics of THree.js were very impoertant to understand the fundatmentals.
Then some of the game world was built theough building objects, such as Textures, transforms, polygonal meshes, shadows. reflection and refraction.

also the programmable pipeline made it easier to implement some functionality.
1.  THe shader program
2.  values for Uniform variableas and attributes
3.  Transforms in GLSL
4.  Framebuffers
